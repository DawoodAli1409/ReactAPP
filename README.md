# ReactAPP

A user form has been designed and a table to save the data. Input validation and form validation are handled using React Hook Form, and MUI components were used for a better layout.

This project was created using Vite and React. It provides a minimal setup with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and ESLint rules.

## Features

- React + Vite
- React Hook Form for input validation
- MUI (Material UI) for UI components
- ESLint configured
- Easily expandable

## Notes on ESLint

If you're building a production-level app, we recommend switching to TypeScript and enabling type-aware ESLint rules. You can refer to the [TypeScript template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) for best practices.
